    <h2 class="paraaaa"><u> Sachin Ramesh Tendulker </u></h2><br><br>
    <p class="paraaaa"> An Indian Former International cricketer
    

    Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and
    arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect
    balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses -
    anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was
    equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull
    them out at will. There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off
    both front foot and back, could tune his technique to suit every condition, temper his game to suit every situation,
    and made runs in all parts of the world in all conditions.
    Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the overwhelmingly dominant team of his era. His century as
    a 19- year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played
    in Australia. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batsman: Don Bradman confided
    to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.
    Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and armed with a loathing for losing, Tendulkar set about doing what it
    took to become one of the best batsmen in the world. His greatness was established early: he was only 16 when he
    made his Test debut. He was hit on the mouth by Waqar Younis but continued to bat, in a blood-soaked shirt. His
    first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he
    turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batsman to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian
    Lara as the leading Test run- scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs 30,000 international
    runs, and 50 Test hundreds.

            <h1>Batting for charity</h1>
            <p>Over the course of a momentous career, Sachin has broken several records. Of all the centuries he has scored, his hundredth, scored against Bangladesh at the Shere Bangla stadium in Mirpur, was one of the most celebrated. The score marked a landmark in international cricket, no one else having come close to the ‘century of centuries’. </p>

            <p>Sachin s daughter Sara s birthday is celebrated at the slums in Mumbai every year. This low-key yet thoughtful celebration again points to Sachin’s drive to give back to society. In a report in DNA, Sachin says,</p>

            <h1>Awareness ads for free</h1>
            <p>According to a Sportskeeda report, in 2011 when Sachin was approached for a Census awareness advertisement, the cricketer relentlessly shot for over nine successive hours to get the piece right. If that wasn’t enough, he also refused to accept any payment for the project. Tendulkar had also endorsed social advertisements and various other consciousness campaigns, free of charge</p>

            <p>Thanks to the master blaster, over 200 underprivileged children are being sponsored for free education. A Mumbai-based NGO, Apnalaya, is the beneficiary. Along with education, Sachin also sponsors articles like stationery and uniforms for the students.</p>
